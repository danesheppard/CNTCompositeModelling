# Nanocomp

This repository contains a python implementation of Xue's thermal conductivity model for CNT nanocomposites ([Xue 2006]([url](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/17/6/020)))

The implementation offers a parameterized version of the model to allow for variation of different variables, and some basic plotting using Matplotlib to get you started on visualization. It also includes a very basic brute force solver (bruteSquad()) to allow you to easily extract the effective thermal conductivity (ke).
